      <p class="text-muted">Windows... the true mind is which shows you an insight into your own self- of your follies, of good times, of memories, of past doings and what could be your possible future decisions. This Church at ST.Xaviers College, Mumbai, India (Best College in the world) has been a place for many students to pray, cry, confess, some of the deepest feelings of a human heart are there and Christ listens to them all even if the world does not listen to you, for it is only fair that we all being his children give and take our feelings with God, for these habits somewhere down the line help us in our pursuit of fulfiing our birth as humans.</p>
